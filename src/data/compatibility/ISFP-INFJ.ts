      en: "From the INFJ perspective, ISFPs offer a refreshing connection to the present moment and sensory world. INFJs admire ISFPs' authenticity and ability to live according to their values without pretense. While INFJs may initially struggle with ISFPs' resistance to abstract theorizing, they often come to appreciate how ISFPs ground their visions in tangible reality. The relationship thrives when INFJs respect ISFPs' need for space and autonomy.",
